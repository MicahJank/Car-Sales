Write out the steps you think you'll need to complete this project. 
It seems silly, but doing this with every project will help you grow into a better developer a lot faster.

STEPS
    pre-steps: install dependencies, redux and react-redux etc.
1. Get all the folders i know i will need and the files created that i will need....actions...reducers..etc.
2. refactor out the state from App.js into a reducer/reducers.
3. Get the provider and store set up inside of the index.js
4. Connect the components to the neccesary state using the connect HOC, mapStateToProps etc.
5. set up handler functions for clicks and other things that will be needing the actions
6. set up the actions in the actions folder using variables for the action.type
